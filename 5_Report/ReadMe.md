# REQUIREMENTS
## INTRODUCTION
 ### In this project ,I have Written a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3x3 grid the game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diag-onal sequence of three marks wins. Your program should draw the game board, ask the user for the coordinates of the next mark, change the players after every successful move, and pronounce the winner.

## Research
### *The Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.

### [Research Link]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

##  Features 

### *player options(X,O) 

### *make start with positions 

### *user friendly setup 


## Defining Our System
###    Using different levels of understanding, the create a three-by-three grid - a total of nine squares - and insert activities into each. player choose any that make 'three in a row. use the tic-tac-toe game to play with brains.
     
    
## SWOT ANALYSIS

### strengths

### * using this game will improve mind power .

### weaknesses

### * this project has better version .

### * so marketing is not easy.

### opportunities

### * this project make easy to learn and make opportunities for biginner to Know abot the game.

### Threats

### *some times there will be some issues regarding system setup(based on the systems).
